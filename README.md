# Computer Programming and Programming Languages 2 (Hardware Software Interface) 
# -- Assignments --

This repository features my implementation for the three CPPL2 assignments:

- A simplified C to Assembly transpiler
- A set of simple tasks in Assembly
- A set of medium tasks in Assembly

Languages: Assembly, C, Makefile

The `medium-tasks`, `simple-tasks` and `transpiler` directories also contain a `README.md` file with a summary of the 
solved tasks, according to the limitations, assumptions and purpose of the tasks. These assignments were 
designed to introduce the principles of Assembly, then to apply them in certain exercises.
