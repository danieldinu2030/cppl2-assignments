# Task 3 - KFibonacci

## Objective

The goal is to **recursively** compute the n-th term of the generalised k-fibonacci sequence.

The first implemented function has the following header:
```c
const int fib(int n, int K);
```

**The first argument** (`n`) represents the order of the term that needs to be computed.

**The second argument** (`K`) represents the order of the KFib sequence that will be used.

The KFib sequence the sequence is generated by the following rule: <p>  
$$  
KFib(n) =  
\begin{cases}  
0, & \text{if } n \lt K \\  
1, & \text{if } n = K \hspace{1cm} \text{for fixed K} \\  
KFib(n - 1) + KFib(n - 2) + \dots + KFib(n - K), & \text{if } n > K  
\end{cases}  
$$ <p>  
Example: $3Fib = 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, \dots$

## Running the Program

- A Makefile with the `build`, `run` and `clean` rules is provided
- Edit the `checker.c` file, declaring the parameters `n` and `K` for testing (or use the default ones)
- From the terminal, enter `make run` and inspect the output
